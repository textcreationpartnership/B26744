            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE general</hi> Alarm <hi>occasion'd by the new</hi> OATH <hi>of</hi> AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGEANCE <hi>gave me no rest, till I got it, and had examined, as well as I could, the</hi> evil <hi>which I perceived many apprehended to be in it.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever what my thoughts are upon the best enquiry and most serious deliberation I could use, I here make bold to publish to the World; not confiding so much in my own judgement, as to hope it shall give full satisfaction to those who need it, or so much as to suppose that I my self may not hereafter meet with reason enough to change my mind; but earnestly desiring that any good Christian that discerns my</hi> Errors (<hi>if such there be) would be so charitable to me as to let me know them, even as</hi> publickly <hi>as I expose them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would I have it so, that</hi> others, <hi>if under the same</hi> mistakes, <hi>may with me have the benefit of so</hi> seasonable a Charity. <hi>I shall ever account it a happy publication of my</hi> weakness <hi>and</hi> ignorance, <hi>which may prevent a</hi> Crime <hi>either in</hi> my self <hi>or</hi> another.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>HAving just now met with the so much talk'd of OATH of <hi>Allegeance,</hi> imposed upon us under the penalties of forfeiting both Estate and Liberty, I have brought it with me, desiring your Opinion of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I am not at all glad to hear, that this <hi>Oath,</hi> whatever it be, is so generally imposed; very much fearing, lest, as most such <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions</hi> have been found to do, it may do more hurt than good. Yet if it be imposed with such <hi>Penalties</hi> to be inflicted on them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it; we are concern'd to consider seriously of it, lest we either wound our <hi>Consciences</hi> in taking it, or be too prodigal of our <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in refusing it. Pray let me hear the words of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The words of the <hi>Oath</hi> are these.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I <hi>A. B.</hi> Do sincerely Promise and Swear, That I will be Faithful, and bear true Allegeance to Their Majesties King WILLIAM and Queen MARY.</p>
               </q>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33509:4"/>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The best way to discern whether or no this <hi>Oath</hi> may be lawfully sworn by us, will be (as I think) to enquire if it may be sworn according to God's directions, (<hi>Jer. 4. 2.) in Truth, in Judgment, and in Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I am of the same Opinion. And <hi>first,</hi> Do you think it may be sworn <hi>in Truth?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Seeing this is a <hi>Promissory Oath,</hi> to swear it in <hi>Truth,</hi> seems to me nothing else, but <hi>truly,</hi> or (as the word in the <hi>Oath</hi> is) <hi>sincerely</hi> to intend to perform what we Promise. And this we may do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, if we Promise no <hi>Impossible, Vain,</hi> or <hi>Ʋnlawful</hi> thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That it is neither <hi>Impossible,</hi> nor <hi>Vain,</hi> supposing it not <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> or <hi>Ʋnrighteous,</hi> I think we may be easily satisfied; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need only enquire, whether it may be sworn in <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but it is necessary also that it be sworn in <hi>Judgment;</hi> What say you to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If we know and consider well, <hi>What, Why,</hi> and to what <hi>End</hi> we swear, and after a rational deliberation are satisfied in mind, that the thing we promise is neither <hi>Impossible, Vain,</hi> nor <hi>Ʋnjust;</hi> we swear in <hi>Judgment.</hi> And therefore what concerns us chiefly to examine, is, if it may be sworn in <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I see plainly it is so. May we then so swear it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If we may swear it without any <hi>wrong</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> or our <hi>Selves,</hi> I think you will grant we may swear it in <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I grant we may.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Wrong is done to <hi>God,</hi> when we break his <hi>Commandments.</hi> What <hi>Law</hi> of God then shall we break in taking this <hi>Oath?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I am afraid lest we should thereby break all the Laws of God commanding <hi>Obedience</hi> to our <hi>Lawful Governours,</hi> and those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that forbid <hi>Vain-swearing</hi> and <hi>Perjury.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>No Law of God commanding Obedience to <hi>Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> is broken by swearing <hi>Allegeance</hi> to our <hi>Lawful King</hi> and <hi>Queen.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That's true; but if they be not so, and Another be our <hi>Lawful King,</hi> in swearing to bear that <hi>Allegeance</hi> to <hi>Them,</hi> which is due to <hi>Him</hi> alone, we break the Laws of Obedience to our <hi>Lawful Governours.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You see then, no wrong is done to God in breaking his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33509:4"/> Laws of Obedience to Lawful Governours, but by doing wrong to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> I mean <hi>Him</hi> who is our <hi>Lawful Governour.</hi> We are therefore no farther concern'd here, but to see that no <hi>wrong</hi> be done to <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>And this we ought very carefully to see to, before we can take this <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is very true, and in order to this, we are first to consider <hi>who</hi> this <hi>Lawful King</hi> is, whom we may wrong by taking the <hi>Oath.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I imagine we are all satisfied, that JAMES the II. had a <hi>Legal Right</hi> to our <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt it not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>And I am not yet satisfied, that He either hath lost, or could lose that <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If he could cease to be <hi>Lawful King,</hi> he could lose that <hi>Right</hi> to our <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That cannot be denied.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If he could cease to be such a <hi>King,</hi> as by the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the Kingdom, our <hi>Kings</hi> must be, he could cease to be <hi>Lawful King.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think that is also plain enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>And I think it is as plain, that our <hi>Constitution</hi> admits of no <hi>King</hi> that will not be <hi>limited</hi> in his Government by the <hi>Laws.</hi> Ours being no <hi>Absolute,</hi> but a <hi>Mixed</hi> and <hi>Limited Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Are we sure of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>We are, I think, sure, That the <hi>King's Will</hi> is not the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his <hi>Power,</hi> but (as K. CHARLES the First of blessed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory acknowledged) <hi>The Law is the Measure of his Will;</hi> That He is only our <hi>Liege,</hi> or <hi>Legal Soveraign,</hi> and the duty we owe him is <hi>Allegeance,</hi> or a <hi>Legal Obedience;</hi> that the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of this Realm have ever been accounted the <hi>Rule</hi> of Government; that the <hi>Regal Power</hi> hath been ordinarily confined to them; that these <hi>Laws</hi> whereby he is bound to Govern, are neither Made nor Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by <hi>his</hi> sole <hi>Authority,</hi> but by the concurrence of the other <hi>Estates</hi> of the Realm. If all this make it not evident that this is no <hi>Absolute,</hi> but a <hi>Limited Monarchy,</hi> nothing can.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Will it hence follow, that a <hi>Legal King</hi> can cease to be so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I think it will very clearly. For seeing our <hi>Constitution</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of no <hi>Absolute Monarch,</hi> if any <hi>King</hi> refuse to be limited by <hi>Law</hi> in his <hi>Government,</hi> and will be <hi>Absolute,</hi> making his <hi>Will</hi> the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33509:5"/> only <hi>Law</hi> by which he will Govern, he ceaseth to be <hi>Lawful King</hi> of this Realm; because he is become such as the <hi>Constitution</hi> will not bear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Shall He hereby lose his <hi>Right</hi> to Govern?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Not his <hi>Right</hi> to Govern by <hi>Law</hi> if he <hi>will</hi> do so, and he hath no other <hi>Right</hi> that I know of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Then it seems he may be <hi>Lawful</hi> or <hi>Rightful King</hi> still, tho' he unjustly claim an <hi>Absolute Power;</hi> for he may be restrained by <hi>Laws</hi> in the <hi>Exercise</hi> of his Power.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laws</hi> indeed may <hi>prescribe</hi> the Limits of his Power, but how shall they <hi>confine</hi> Him within those Limits, if he will be <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Boundless?</hi> What signifies a <hi>Limitation</hi> that can limit him no farther than he <hi>will</hi> be limited? Will he not be as <hi>Absolute</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing such <hi>Laws,</hi> as he could be without them, if he can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit no <hi>Right</hi> by transgressing them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Must a King needs lose his <hi>Right</hi> to Govern, by any transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Laws,</hi> whereby his <hi>Authority</hi> is limited?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>By no means. Nay all <hi>tolerable</hi> transgressions of the Law, and very <hi>many</hi> and <hi>great</hi> grievances ought to be born, rather than the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of a Kingdom should be hazarded by disturbing the Government. Neither do I think that a <hi>King</hi> can forfeit his <hi>Right</hi> to govern, so long as by any means he may be reduced to a <hi>Legal exercise</hi> of his Authority, or will be content to <hi>Reign</hi> without the <hi>subversion</hi> of the Government, and the <hi>ruine</hi> of his people.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How shall we understand when he will not be content with this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When after all Legal means used for his due <hi>information</hi> and just <hi>restraint;</hi> he shall either by <hi>Word or Deed</hi> manifestly <hi>declare</hi> it to be his resolution to be <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and no longer to be limited by any <hi>Law</hi> but his own <hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But the <hi>King</hi> has a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> his <hi>Power</hi> is of God, and can he forfeit that by transgressing the Laws of <hi>Men?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>When you say, <hi>His power is of God,</hi> is this your meaning; That this very <hi>individual Person,</hi> suppose it <hi>JAMES</hi> the Second, was <hi>named</hi> or <hi>pointed out</hi> by God (as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were) to be <hi>King</hi> yea and <hi>Absolute Monarch</hi> of this Realm?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have no such meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then you can mean no more, but that <hi>Government</hi> in every Nation is of <hi>Divine Institution,</hi> and when any <hi>Person</hi> is once <hi>Legally</hi> invested in it, whether the <hi>Authority</hi> be convey'd to him by <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Succession,</hi> it is of God.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33509:5"/>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That is my meaning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then that <hi>Authority</hi> is neither more nor less, than <hi>He</hi> or <hi>They</hi> by whom 'tis derived unto him, <hi>is</hi> or <hi>were</hi> invested in by the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Constitution</hi> of the Kingdom, provided it be sufficient for the <hi>ends</hi> of Government.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have nothing to say against that at present.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I hope we may also take it for granted. That the <hi>Right</hi> the <hi>King</hi> hath from God, is to be <hi>a Minister of God for the good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that under him they may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Honesty;</hi> and that they through whom this Right was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to him never consented or meant that he should abuse it to their <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>ruine.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This cannot be gainsaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then I think a <hi>King</hi> in <hi>declaring</hi> his resolution not to regard the right <hi>ends</hi> of Government, nor any <hi>Law</hi> but his own <hi>Will,</hi> tho' it tend not to the <hi>preservation,</hi> but <hi>subversion</hi> of the established Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to the <hi>protecting,</hi> but the <hi>inslaving</hi> or <hi>ruining</hi> his people; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares</hi> his resolution to be no longer <hi>lawful King,</hi> either by <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Human Right.</hi> Destroying the <hi>Original Constitution</hi> of the Government, he undermines and Subverts his own <hi>Authority</hi> thereby, and absolves his Subjects from <hi>Allegeance</hi> to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>This being a weighty point, I desire a little better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> holds his <hi>Crown,</hi> as his Subjects do their <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> by the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of the Kingdom: if he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>subvert</hi> that whereon his <hi>Authority</hi> stands, the <hi>Legal Constitution</hi> of the Kingdom, he must needs overthrow his own <hi>Legal Authority.</hi> All that we owe him is a <hi>Legal Obedience;</hi> destroying the <hi>Laws</hi> he quits that, and onely challengeth what we owe him not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in truth we owe him nothing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>By what you have said, I am now convinced that a <hi>Legal King</hi> may cease to be so, and when he ceases to be so, no <hi>Allegeance</hi> can be due unto him. The next thing to be examined is, whether <hi>JAMES</hi> the 2d who was once our <hi>Legal King,</hi> have ceased or no to be any longer so. What think you of that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>That we must now examine, by applying to <hi>Him</hi> what we have already said. If <hi>He</hi> then hath in effect <hi>declared,</hi> that he would no longer rule us as his <hi>Legal Subjects</hi> by <hi>Laws,</hi> but as <hi>Slaves</hi> by an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power; he hath quitted his <hi>Lawful Authority,</hi> which was all he had, and assumed an <hi>Authority</hi> which is none of his;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33509:6"/> and thereby hath absolved us from our <hi>Allegeance</hi> to Him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>How did he <hi>declare</hi> this, when in his <hi>Declaration</hi> he promised to protect us in our <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Properties?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>What signifies a <hi>Verbal promise,</hi> which was in <hi>Deed</hi> broken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as soon as made? All it teacheth us is, not to believe such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises again, till we can have better evidence of his intentions, and better security too for the performance than I know which way he can give us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But where do you find his <hi>Declaration</hi> not to Govern by Law?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>In his challenging to himself expresly an <hi>Absolute Power,</hi> and requiring to have his will obey'd <hi>without reserve.</hi> In <hi>Suspending</hi> some <hi>Laws</hi> for ever, and <hi>Dispensing</hi> with others at pleasure, and calling this his <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Prerogative.</hi> In <hi>Licensing</hi> persons to act in <hi>Office</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Law, and putting them out of Office that would not own and assert his Right so to do. In imposing <hi>Illegal</hi> things, and <hi>punishing</hi> such as according to their known <hi>duty</hi> only in the most Legal way <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd</hi> to be excused. In erecting <hi>Illegal Courts</hi> in an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way, to eject men out of their undoubted <hi>Free-holds,</hi> meerly for adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Laws. In treating with, and receiving a <hi>Nuncio</hi> from that <hi>Forreign Power</hi> which the whole Nation is sworn to oppose. In admitting an <hi>order</hi> of men into his <hi>Privy-Council,</hi> for which it is <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to enter the Kingdom. In using base <hi>Arts</hi> to pack <hi>Parliaments</hi> of men by Law disabled for that trust. In over-awing the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to submission to his <hi>Arbitrariness</hi> by an <hi>Army</hi> kept a foot-in times of peace. I add no more but this only, in <hi>Deserting</hi> his people, leaving them without means of Government, and to the mercy of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded <hi>Army,</hi> and meerly because he would not hearken to any Treaty, or endure to hear of being tied to Govern by Law.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Filled it indeed, but how? If <hi>JAMES</hi> the 2d have left it vacant, why was it not filled with the next undoubted <hi>Heir?</hi>

               <p>Why then may you not <hi>swear</hi> to do, what you <hi>resolve</hi> to do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Because in this Oath I seem to assert their <hi>Right</hi> which is yet doubtful.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I am sure we do not in this <hi>Oath expresly</hi> assert any <hi>Right</hi> they have.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But it seems that <hi>Implicitly</hi> at least we do. For they are here stiled <hi>Their Majesties,</hi> and are called <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and it must be supposed they are so, when we swear <hi>Allegeance</hi> to them, else the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33509:7"/>
                  <hi>Oath</hi> is a <hi>Mockery,</hi> and <hi>a taking God's name in vain.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>But is it <hi>implied,</hi> that they are <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Rightful King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and that we <hi>assert</hi> them to be so, as we did <hi>expresly</hi> do in the late <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegeance?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think this is <hi>implied,</hi> for <hi>Allegeance</hi> is due to such only, and that's it we swear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Who is to <hi>interpret</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> where the meaning is dubious?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Imposers</hi> of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Was there not a debate among them about these words <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Rightful?</hi> And were they not <hi>purposely</hi> left out, lest they should create <hi>Scruples</hi> in them who are to take the <hi>Oath?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis said it was so.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>To what purpose was this <hi>omission</hi> of those words, if what they signify must still be look'd upon as <hi>implied</hi> in the <hi>Oath?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I know not that. But I am sure if this be not <hi>implied,</hi> it seems to me a very <hi>vain,</hi> and therefore <hi>unlawful Oath.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Why so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Because admitting this, we swear as good as <hi>nothing.</hi> For <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance</hi> being that <hi>Obedience</hi> which is due by the <hi>Laws</hi> to our <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign,</hi> if they be not <hi>Lawful King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> no such <hi>obedience</hi> can be due to them by the <hi>Laws;</hi> and swearing no other, I swear as good as <hi>nothing,</hi> a very <hi>vain Oath.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>It is granted, that the <hi>Laws</hi> prescribe and bound the <hi>Obedience</hi> which is due to our <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> so that no other hath a <hi>right</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> to that <hi>Obedience,</hi> nor need we by <hi>Law</hi> to pay him any other; and in this sense 'tis called <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But how can we swear to pay that which is <hi>due</hi> to our <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> and to <hi>him only,</hi> to those whom we need not suppose to be so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>May we not in many cases swear to <hi>pay</hi> one that which is not by any <hi>Law</hi> beforehand his <hi>right</hi> and <hi>due?</hi> And will not such an <hi>Oath</hi> create to him a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>due,</hi> which was not his before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I grant it in some cases, but not where it will be to anothers <hi>wrong,</hi> and it must needs be a <hi>wrong</hi> to our <hi>Lawful Soveraign</hi> to pay his <hi>due</hi> to another.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Tho' the <hi>Legal Soveraign</hi> alone can Challenge our <hi>Allegeance</hi> as his <hi>Debt</hi> and <hi>Due;</hi> may we not promise the <hi>like</hi> obedience to <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> without <hi>wrong</hi> to <hi>him?</hi> I owe <hi>you</hi> by bond <hi>Twenty pounds,</hi> may I not pay the <hi>like Sum</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> to whom I owe it not, without wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>you?</hi> Or may I not <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>Swear</hi> to him beforehand to do it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33509:7"/> and make it so a <hi>Legal</hi> debt, tho no <hi>Law</hi> bound me before either to <hi>promise</hi> or <hi>pay</hi> it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt you may, so you pay <hi>me</hi> too what you owe me. But how we can swear <hi>Allegeance,</hi> to <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> as <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> and yet pay our <hi>Allegeance</hi> to our <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> supposing another be so, I see not. This were <hi>to serve two Masters,</hi> to set up two <hi>Soveraign Powers</hi> in one Kingdom, and indeed to swear <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I pay the <hi>Service I owe</hi> to <hi>one</hi> man as to my <hi>Master,</hi> whose <hi>due</hi> it is. I pay the <hi>like Service</hi> to <hi>another</hi> whose <hi>due</hi> it is not, nor own I <hi>him</hi> thereby for my <hi>Master:</hi> To the one I pay a <hi>debt,</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I bestow a <hi>largess</hi> or <hi>boon.</hi> I pay my <hi>Allegeance</hi> to my <hi>Soveraign</hi> as far as I can. I yield the <hi>like obedience</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> not as my <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,</hi> but as one whom I have other reasons thus to <hi>oblige.</hi> The former has his <hi>due,</hi> the later <hi>more</hi> than is <hi>due,</hi> but no more than I think fit. Where's now the <hi>Impossibility</hi> or <hi>Injustice?</hi> A <hi>penny</hi> was one labourer's due, and a <hi>penny</hi> was more than was due to another; yet were they paid alike, the one had no <hi>wrong,</hi> nor the <hi>other too much.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Yet I see not how this can be done in our present case.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Our <hi>Case</hi> is this: The <hi>Imposers</hi> of this <hi>Oath</hi> have concluded, That <hi>JAMES</hi> the 2d is no longer our <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> but <hi>WILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AM</hi> and <hi>MARY.</hi> Yet do they not require that we should <hi>expresly</hi> swear <hi>this,</hi> but only that we will, whilst they govern us, <hi>obey</hi> them in all their <hi>Legal Commands,</hi> which is the very <hi>same</hi> and <hi>all</hi> which we are bound by <hi>Law</hi> to do towards our <hi>Lawful Soveraign,</hi> if any other be so. And our <hi>Question</hi> is, Whether we may swear this or no?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think we may not, because it is not certain that <hi>another</hi> is not our <hi>Lawful King,</hi> and we may not swear away his <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>If all that was said above be true, <hi>JAMES</hi> the 2d is not our <hi>Lawful King.</hi> Yet we are willing at present to suppose it <hi>doubtful</hi> whether he be or no, and what has been last said is in order to their Satisfaction who yet <hi>doubt</hi> of this.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>We may not swear he is not <hi>Lawful King,</hi> whilst we <hi>doubt</hi> of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Neither are we required to swear it, but only to be <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient</hi> to the <hi>Present King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> ruling by the <hi>Laws</hi> of this <hi>Realm.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think we may <hi>swear</hi> this, whilst we <hi>doubt</hi> that another may be <hi>wrong'd</hi> by it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Must the Nation be <hi>ungovern'd</hi> till all our <hi>doubts</hi> about the <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> be removed?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I say not so, for <hi>Government</hi> is God's <hi>Ordinance,</hi> which no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can <hi>wilfully</hi> and <hi>innocently</hi> be without.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> should whose <hi>right</hi> it is.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>True, but <hi>He,</hi> whom you now suppose to have the <hi>right,</hi> has <hi>deserted</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> and cannot <hi>Govern.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Possibly, he was <hi>driven</hi> out by force.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>They whom we intrusted to enquire into that and other things do assure us he was not. Who should drive him away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Pr.</hi> of <hi>Or,</hi> and his <hi>Assistants.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Then the <hi>Pr.</hi> by the help of his <hi>Assistants</hi> is become a <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and if <hi>Conquest</hi> create so good a <hi>Right,</hi> that some have thought it the best <hi>Title</hi> that any of our <hi>Kings</hi> could have, and thence have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that they were <hi>Absolute Monarchs,</hi> why hath not <hi>King WILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AM</hi> as good a <hi>Right</hi> as any that were before him?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I have no mind to dispute about that.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Nor need you, for I think 'tis plain enough that <hi>JAMES</hi> the 2d <hi>voluntarily</hi> forsook the Kingdom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Had it not been fit however to have <hi>treated</hi> with him about <hi>returning</hi> to his <hi>Government,</hi> before another was seated in his <hi>Throne?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Had they who are best able to judge what's sit in such a case taken that course, I should have thought no worse of them for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it might have tended to many men's better <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> Yet I confess I cannot see to what <hi>other</hi> purpose it would have been. For either he would have disdain'd such a <hi>Treaty,</hi> as below him, or he would not have consented to govern by <hi>Law;</hi> or if he would, he could not have given us better <hi>assurance</hi> that he would do so, than he had beforehand given us that he would not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Why then had we not rather a <hi>Regent</hi> in his name, than a <hi>King</hi> in his stead?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Had he been either <hi>Infant</hi> or <hi>Lunatick,</hi> this might have done, but to a <hi>Person</hi> of his <hi>Age, Temper</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> a <hi>Prison</hi> and a <hi>Fetter</hi> would have been as easy as a <hi>Regent.</hi> To be short, 'tis fit the <hi>Nation</hi> in his absence should be well <hi>govern'd,</hi> and who fitter for the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> than the next <hi>Heir,</hi> or <hi>He</hi> who hath it by <hi>her</hi> consent? And whilst they <hi>Govern</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> 'tis our duty to obey them, and what it is our <hi>duty</hi> to do, I think we may <hi>swear</hi> to do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>But not if we <hi>doubt</hi> whether it be our <hi>duty</hi> or no.</p>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I pray consider it well. The <hi>wrong</hi> done to another, if any at all, is to <hi>One</hi> who will not <hi>exercise</hi> his <hi>Right</hi> as he ought to do, and you do no more but <hi>doubt</hi> whether he be <hi>wrong'd</hi> or no. What is this in comparison of the <hi>Wrong</hi> which a whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> sustains for want of <hi>Government?</hi> And <hi>Government</hi> it must want if we will not <hi>obey</hi> our <hi>present Governors.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Perjury</hi> then you are afraid of is only on <hi>supposition</hi> that <hi>he</hi> to whom you swore is as much <hi>now</hi> our <hi>Lawful King,</hi> as <hi>then</hi> he was; for if he be not so, your <hi>Allegeance</hi> is at an end, and your <hi>Oath</hi> too. Do you think we are bound by that <hi>Oath, not to live in Obedience</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Present K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> whilst they command by <hi>Law</hi> things <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Lawful?</hi>

               <p>If we be not thereby obliged, <hi>not to obey their Legal Commands,</hi> then may we <hi>obey</hi> them, and then may we, when call'd to it, for their <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and our own <hi>safety, swear</hi> to obey them.

               <p>I use it not as an <hi>Argument</hi> to prove the taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> to be <hi>lawful,</hi> but propound it as a thing deserving their <hi>consideration</hi> who dare not take the <hi>Oath,</hi> and yet venture thus to <hi>Pray;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it as lawful to do <hi>both</hi> as to do <hi>either;</hi> and not finding that there is any danger in not doing the one more than in not doing the other.</p>

               <p>Let us keep to the question before us. I am satisfied, that if <hi>JAMES</hi> the II. be not yet our <hi>Lawful King,</hi> and if K. <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Q. <hi>MARY</hi> have a <hi>good Title,</hi> we may Swear <hi>Allegeance</hi> to them, but not otherwise.</p>

               <p>I am satisfied, that this <hi>Monarchy</hi> is no <hi>Absolute,</hi> but a <hi>Limited Monarchy;</hi> that therefore any King of <hi>England,</hi> that will not be <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> according to the <hi>Fundamental Constitution</hi> of this Government, is no longer <hi>Legal King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> that <hi>JAMES</hi> the II hath super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundantly shewn that he would not be so <hi>Limited;</hi> and therefore that he is no longer <hi>Legal King</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>

               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>I am satisfied, that we have no reason to believe there is in being such a thing as a <hi>true Prince of Wales,</hi> and that therefore the PRINCESS of <hi>ORANGE</hi> was the <hi>Rightful Heir;</hi> that being made Q. of <hi>England,</hi> she hath her <hi>Right;</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>ORANGE,</hi> being by <hi>Her</hi> Consent join'd with <hi>Her</hi> in the <hi>Government,</hi> and having the Sole <hi>Administration</hi> thereof committed to him, and both of them having accepted of the <hi>Crown</hi> upon these <hi>Terms, He</hi> is also <hi>rightful King of</hi> England.</p>

               <p>If this be so, we may lawfully Swear this <hi>Oath.</hi> But, put the case, that <hi>some</hi> there be, and it may be not a <hi>few,</hi> who really think, that <hi>James the II.</hi> is yet our <hi>Legal King,</hi> and that <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> are but <hi>Invaders</hi> of the <hi>Regal Dignity,</hi> may these Swear <hi>Allegeance</hi> to them?</p>

               <p>Have they any reason to hope, that returning, He would be content to <hi>pardon</hi> all that is past, and to Govern by the establish'd <hi>Laws</hi> for the future, never endeavouring to settle <hi>Popery</hi> by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor to re-assume an <hi>Arbitrary Authority?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose then He were <hi>re-call'd</hi> and <hi>re-inthroned,</hi> and should bring in his beloved <hi>Counsellors</hi> the <hi>Jesuits</hi> along with him, and fall to the old trade again, would these men patiently suffer their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> and possibly <hi>Lives</hi> too to be <hi>invaded</hi> and <hi>destroy'd,</hi> and the whole <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> ruin'd?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>They would possibly think of setting up a <hi>Regent,</hi> or putting the command of the <hi>Army</hi> into other hands, and so leave <hi>Him</hi> only the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>King;</hi> I know not what else could be done.</p>

               <p>And would not this be a violation of the former <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance,</hi> as well as what is now done?</p>

               <p>Well then, <hi>He</hi> is in a <hi>present incapacity</hi> to <hi>Govern</hi> us, and no hopes have we that if he were recall'd he would protect us by the <hi>Laws,</hi> but rather endeavour to destroy both <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>Laws;</hi> and if he should endeavour this, as he hath already done, either we must suffer it when it is in our power to prevent it, and so be <hi>Accessories</hi> to it; or we must take the same course that is <hi>now</hi> taken; I can think of no other, unless they should think that of <hi>Forty Eight</hi> better, as I hope they will not.</p>

               <p>Government being <hi>God's Ordinance,</hi> and the end of it, next to his <hi>glory,</hi> being the <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> of the whole Nation, and the maintaining it in the exercise of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Justice, Peace</hi> and good <hi>Order;</hi> we ought not to rest contentedly without it; and whilst <hi>He</hi> who is supposed to be our <hi>Legal King</hi> is under an <hi>incapacity</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning us, or will not Govern us by <hi>Law,</hi> but by his own <hi>Will,</hi> whereby the true <hi>ends</hi> of Government will be lost to us, which is evidently our case; and <hi>others</hi> in the mean time undertake the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and manage it <hi>legally</hi> and <hi>hopefully</hi> as to the attaining of all those <hi>ends:</hi> I am verily perswaded we <hi>may</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> them, whatever <hi>Title</hi> they have, so long as they are <hi>actually</hi> our Governors. And if we may <hi>obey</hi> them, seeing the <hi>publick peace</hi> and <hi>welfare</hi> depends so much upon it, we may also <hi>Swear</hi> to obey them.</p>

               <p>Neither is it our concern how it will; but either we ought to <hi>obey</hi> in this case, and may <hi>Swear</hi> obedience when call'd to it, or we must hazard <hi>wilfully,</hi> not only our <hi>personal,</hi> but the <hi>Nations</hi> peace and safety, yea, and that of this <hi>Protestant Church,</hi> and for ought I know of <hi>all others;</hi> we must disobey <hi>Them</hi> in their <hi>just</hi> and <hi>legal commands</hi> (obedience to no other being required) to <hi>whom</hi> under God we owe as great a <hi>Deliverance</hi> as ever was wrought for this Kingdom, and our present free enjoyment of our <hi>Religion, Laws, Estates, Lives</hi> and <hi>Liberties;</hi> we must voluntarily run into <hi>confusion,</hi> or put our Necks into the Yoak of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and all this meerly for the sake of <hi>One</hi> who has done his utmost indeavour to <hi>enslave</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> us, and we have too good <hi>assurance</hi> that he would do so again whenever it should be in his power. Whether this would be a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>commendable</hi> thing I leave to your consideration.</p>

               <p>If there be <hi>reason</hi> for it, tho' it be not thought <hi>wise,</hi> yet may it be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>commendable.</hi>

               <p>I say, 'tis no <hi>wrong</hi> to <hi>him</hi> who is in an <hi>incapacity</hi> to Govern, to <hi>obey them</hi> who can and will Govern us by our <hi>Laws,</hi> whilst he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>incapacity.</hi> And he is so, not only whilst he is, as <hi>they</hi> will have it, in <hi>exile;</hi> but so long as he <hi>will not</hi> Govern according to <hi>Law.</hi> The good <hi>reason</hi> then that we have <hi>not to obey,</hi> or not to <hi>Swear</hi> to obey our <hi>present K.</hi> and <hi>Q.</hi> is this: Because we think a <hi>Legal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> that is, <hi>Allegeance,</hi> due to <hi>Him</hi> only, to whom we are too well assured it will not be <hi>acceptable,</hi> because it is not an <hi>illegal</hi> one, or, because we think <hi>He</hi> hath something to say for a <hi>Right</hi> to Govern us, which he has declared he will not <hi>exercise</hi> but contrary to the <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> on which that <hi>Right,</hi> if any, must be founded, and contrary to the <hi>welfare</hi> and <hi>happiness</hi> of his Kingdom; <hi>that is,</hi> because he claims a <hi>Right</hi> which neither <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> ever gave him, to govern only by his own <hi>Will.</hi> All comes to this, they think he hath a <hi>Right</hi> which he will not <hi>use,</hi> and which they would <hi>give</hi> him, but he will not <hi>thank</hi> them for it; and he challenges a <hi>Right</hi> which they cannot <hi>own,</hi> and will have that yielded him, or he will have <hi>none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This let us now <hi>well consider,</hi> and the wise God direct us.</p>
